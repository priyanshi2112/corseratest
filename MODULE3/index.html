			  <p >Humans are vertebrates, animals having a vertabral column or backbone. They rely on a sturdy internal frame 
			  that is centered on a prominent spine. The human skeletal system consists of bones, cartilage, ligaments and 
			  tendons and accounts for about 20 percent of the body weight.The living bones in our bodies use oxygen and give 
			  off waste products in metabolism. They contain active tissues that consume nutrients, require a blood supply and 
			  change shape or remodel in response to variations in mechanical stress. Bones provide a rigid framework, known as 
			  the skeleton, that support and protect the soft organs of the body.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

			  <p class="item-name"id="menu2">Muscular System</p>
			  <p>The muscular system is composed of specialized cells called muscle fibers. Their predominant function is 
			  contractibility. Muscles, attached to bones or internal organs and blood vessels, are responsible for movement. 
			  Nearly all movement in the body is the result of muscle contraction. Exceptions to this are the action of cilia,
			  the flagellum on sperm cells, and amoeboid movement of some white blood cells. The integrated action of joints,
			  bones, and skeletal muscles produces obvious movements such as walking and running. Skeletal muscles also produce 
			  more subtle movements that result in various facial expressions, eye movements, and respiration.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>

			  <p class="item-name" id="menu3">Nervous System</p>
			  <p >The nervous system is the major controlling, regulatory, and communicating system in the body. It is the 
			  center of all mental activity including thought, learning, and memory. Together with the endocrine system, the 
			  nervous system is responsible for regulating and maintaining homeostasis. Through its receptors, the nervous 
			  system keeps us in touch with our environment, both external and internal. Like other systems in the body, the 
			  nervous system is composed of organs, principally the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and ganglia. These, in turn, 
			  consist of various tissues, including nerve, blood, and connective tissue. Together these carry out the complex
			  activities of the nervous system.<a href="#top">(Back to Top)</a></p>
